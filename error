return 
<div>
			Hello World!
			</div>
the things be returned should go right after the return, cant skip a line.

=>2.
when I declare an object, there are a couple of things need to notice;
javascript doesnt use "=" to assign value, it uses ":" instead
after we decalre one member variable in the object, we shold use "," to split it from followoing declaration
the last one should end without any symbols;
Ex:
var options = {
		title : "message",
		number : 108
	};
